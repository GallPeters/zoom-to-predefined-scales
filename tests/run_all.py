"""Convenience entry point: run every test in this package in one call.

From the QGIS Python Console, with the repository checked out somewhere on
disk::

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, r"<path to the repository root>")
    from tests import run_all
    run_all.main()

From a shell, using QGIS's own Python interpreter, run from the repository
root so the relative imports inside the package resolve correctly::

    python3 -m tests.run_all

The plugin's own Settings dialog has a "Run Tests" button that does the
above automatically - see settings_dialog.SettingsDialog._run_tests() - when
a ``tests/`` folder is found as a sibling of the running plugin's own
directory (true for a development checkout; not the case for a normal
end-user install, which only ships ``src/``'s contents, unless it was
installed together with its ``tests/`` folder).

    """Discover and run every ``test_*.py`` module in this package.

    ``start_dir``/``top_level_dir`` are passed as real filesystem paths
    rather than left for unittest to infer from ``__package__``/``sys.argv``.
    That inference only reliably works when this is launched with
    ``python -m tests.run_all``; called as a plain function - exactly what
    both the documented Python Console usage and the Settings dialog's "Run
    Tests" button do - it silently imported each ``test_*.py`` as a bare
    top-level module instead of ``tests.test_*``, which broke every module
    using relative imports with "attempted relative import with no known
    parent package". Explicit paths make this work the same way regardless
    of how ``main()`` itself was reached.

    Wrapped in a snapshot/restore of the active QgsProject's predefined
    -scale view settings (see ``_project_guard``), so running this from
    inside a live QGIS session never leaves the user's own project's scale
    configuration altered, regardless of what any individual test does or
    whether it raises.

    ``resultclass``, when given, is passed straight through to
    ``unittest.TextTestRunner`` - the Settings dialog's "Run Tests" button
    uses this to pump the Qt event loop between tests (see
    ``SettingsDialog._run_tests()``), so a run that takes a while keeps the
    whole application visibly responsive instead of looking like it has
    frozen. Left as ``None`` (unittest's own default) for the plain
    command-line/Python-Console entry point, which has no Qt event loop to
    keep pumping in the first place.

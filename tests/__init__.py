Test suite for the Zoom to Predefined Scales plugin.

Works from either of the two layouts the plugin's own modules can be found
in, detected automatically below rather than assumed:

* the git-checkout layout: this ``tests/`` folder sits at the repository
  root, a sibling of ``src/`` (developer/QA tooling, not part of what gets
  installed - only ``src/``'s contents are packaged into a release);
* an installed-plugin layout: ``tests/`` copied *inside* the plugin's own
  install folder, alongside ``zoom_to_predefined_scale.py`` and the rest -
  the natural result of installing the plugin *with* its tests rather than
  without them (exactly what a release zip built for the QGIS plugin portal
  contains: a single top-level folder holding both).

Either way, the folder actually holding ``zoom_to_predefined_scale.py`` is
registered as a real package under the synthetic name ``_ztps_plugin`` -
never hard-coded to ``src`` - and every test module imports from that fixed
name instead, e.g. ``from _ztps_plugin import scale_utils`` or
``from _ztps_plugin.scale_lock_controller import ScaleLockController``.

A synthetic *package* (not a bare ``sys.path`` insertion + plain module
imports) is required because the plugin's own modules import each other with
relative imports - ``zoom_to_predefined_scale.py`` has ``from
.scale_lock_controller import ...``, ``scale_lock_controller.py`` has
``from .project_scales import ...``, and so on - exactly as they do once
QGIS installs and imports the real plugin package. Importing them as bare
top-level modules leaves each one with no package context of its own, and
those relative imports then fail with "attempted relative import with no
known parent package". Giving the located directory a real (if arbitrarily
named) package identity, with ``submodule_search_locations`` pointing at it,
is what makes those relative imports resolve correctly regardless of what
the plugin's real install folder is actually called.

Exercises the plugin's own logic against a real QGIS/PyQt6 environment -
``qgis.testing`` (started once here, before any test module runs) rather
than mocks for the QGIS-facing pieces, since scale locking is fundamentally
about reacting to real ``QgsProject``/``QgsMapCanvas`` signal behaviour.

How to run:

    From the QGIS Python Console, with the repository (or an installed copy
    that includes this ``tests/`` folder) somewhere on disk::

        import sys
        sys.path.insert(0, r"<path to the folder CONTAINING tests/>")
        from tests import run_all
        run_all.main()

    From a shell, with QGIS's own Python interpreter, run from that same
    folder so the relative "tests" package resolves::

        python3 -m tests.run_all

    The plugin's own Settings dialog also has a "Run Tests" button that does
    the above automatically when a ``tests/`` folder is found either nested
    inside the running plugin's own directory, or as a sibling of it one
    level up (see ``settings_dialog.SettingsDialog._tests_directory()``) -
    not the case for a normal end-user install, which only ships ``src/``'s
    contents with no ``tests/`` anywhere nearby; the button reports that
    plainly rather than failing silently.

Nothing here is run automatically when the plugin loads - these are
developer/QA tests, run on demand, not a startup check.

# one that QGIS Desktop itself already constructed and initialised before

# button, executing inside the user's already-open, already-initialised
# session. Attempting to start a second one there does not fail cleanly - it
# surfaces many calls later as a confusing, unrelated-looking TypeError from

# first, ourselves, is what actually makes this safe either way: a

# gets one bootstrapped exactly as before; a live QGIS session already has
